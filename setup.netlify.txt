 Steps to Create a Netlify Cloud Function

1. Install Netlify CLI

If you don’t already have it:

```
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

Login to Netlify:

```
netlify login
```

---

2. Create a Project Folder

```
mkdir my-netlify-funcs
cd my-netlify-funcs
```

---

3. Initialize Netlify Project

```
netlify init
```

 Link to an existing Netlify site or create a new one.
 This generates a `.netlify` folder.

---

4. Create Functions Folder

Inside your project, create a `netlify/functions` folder:

```
mkdir -p netlify/functions
```

---

5. Write Your First Function

Example: `netlify/functions/hello.js`

```js
exports.handler = async function(event, context) {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello from Netlify Functions!" }),
  };
};
```

---

6. Test Locally

Run the dev server:

```
netlify dev
```

 Now open:
[http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello](http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello)

You should see:

```
{ "message": "Hello from Netlify Functions!" }
```

---

7. Deploy to Netlify

```
netlify deploy --prod
```

After deployment, your function will be available at:

```
https://<your-site>.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/hello
```

---

 That’s it! You now have a working Netlify Cloud Function.
